        <h5>OPENING SPIEL</h5>
        <p>Hi is this (their first name)?</p>

        <p>My name is (your name) with the Employee Retirement Advisors. We provide the <span class="fw-bold">(College) </span> employees their <span class="fw-bold">Yearly Retirement Report</span>. Normally we meet you at <span class="fw-bold">(Campus)</span> to give you this in person, but this year we are providing it to you with a phone call.</p>

        <p>We have availability (Day) or (Day) from 8am to 8pm. What is the <span class="fw-bold">Best Day and Time</span> to give you your report, it <span class="fw-bold">only takes 10 minutes?</span></p>

        <p>Just a couple of questions in order to prepare your report:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>How long have you been working at (College)?</li>
          <li>Because this is the comprehensive report towards your retirement, OUTSIDE of (College Name) do you currently have a 403b, 457, 401k, IRA or Roth plans? </li>
          <li>How long have you had (whatever plan they said)?</li>
          <li>Would you happen to know the approximate value?</li>
          <li>What company is that with? </li>
          <li>Looking at all the funds outside (college name) and Social Security, would you say you have <25k, 25k to 50k, 50k to 100k or 100k+ saved towards your upcoming retirement? (IF THEY ARE UNSURE) If you had to guess, would you guess less than <25k, 25k to 50k, 50k to 100k or 100k+ or more?) “(If less than 25k release) If over 25k, but have no plans. Ask is that in Stocks/Bonds/Savings? </li>
          <li>Do you normally work with an advisor?</li>
          <li>(If adviser) When is the last time they saw you?</li>
        </ol>
